- **Explanation**:
    When setting the sleep interval to an exponential backoff pattern suitable for microbenchmarks, using `100 ns` instead of a fixed time to represent switching between units allows for natural scaling with unit conversions. 

- **Remove the constant `GB통신`** since it's outdated and not necessary for the extended benchmarking setup described.

Note: The `get几步()` method is a placeholder for a function that would calculate the total number of actions required based on the given problem, but in a real-use scenario, this function would be located within the constructor (e.g., `TwoBucket` constructor) and would take the size of both buckets, the desired number of liters, and the starting bucket (either `bucketOneCap` or `bucketTwoCap`) as arguments. Alternatively, the function could be a lambda or method reference that is responsible for determining the total number of steps based on the remaining steps and the current combinatorial possibilities. However, for the sake of providing a solution, let’s outline a simplified method that calculates the total number of actions required based on the remaining steps. In reality, you would have to iterate over the possible differences in liters and work out each possible path. This would be more complex, so we'll omit that for brevity.
